<h2>User Research</h2>
<p style="font-family:roboto;">User research is the first and essential step in product development process. Even user research seems time consuming with low ROI, this process will lead us to analyse the problem and help to get better results with the way more efficient and faster. With the right user research analysis, we could avoid unnecessary step and cost during develop product.
 <br><br>As a result of working as a user researcher woth my previous project, I have gained numerous skills needed to effectively communicate with users and thoroughly understand their goals, needs, and pain points.</p>
<h2>Design Thinking</h2>
<p style="font-family:roboto;">Design thinking is an approach to creative problem solving that can be applied in many different disciplines and it is often used in product development. Design thinking helps to solve variety of different problems and relies on the ability to be intuitive, spot patterns, and create ideas that are not only meaningful & functional, but also pleased to see.

  <br> <br> What I love about design thinking, is that it involves ongoing experimentation in the form of rough sketching, paper prototyping, constant testing, validating and improving different concepts and ideas. This is where I can boost my creativity to solve the problem and have fun during work.</p>
<h2>Usability Testing</h2>
<p style="font-family:roboto;">Usability testing is my favorite UX research method. I believe that the quality of the experience should be measured through the (objective) user behavior, rather than (subjective) opinions of a person at hand. With usability tests, we are not testing if it works, we are testing how it works, and what the experience is.

    <br><br>During my UX Design experiment, I conducted several usability tests (web and mobile) and feel very comfortable using that method.</p>
